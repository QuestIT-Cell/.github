**Hi there! üëã**

QuestIT is the heart and soul of workshops, events and contests for the students in the IT Department at VESIT. We aim to create a network of students, form a community, the result of which is to create a growth-promoting atmosphere for everyone to enjoy and excel. In this quest for excellence, we are completely supported by the students of this very department who're willing to make significant contributions to set new benchmarks for the students to come.

# Our Vision

The vision of QuestIT is to form a community of _students_ across the INFT Department and enable them to enhance their technical and non-technical skills in collaboration. We aim to cater to students individually and assist them in achieving their goals. 

# About Workshops and Events

- INFT Students (Second Year onwards) are eligible to register for all QuestIT workshops and events (unless the event specifically caters to a batch)
- Students can register by filling a Google form shared via email
- All event and workshop resources can be found on their respective GitHub repositories on this page. Feel free to look around. 

# The Council Structure

- Recruitments for the council open at the start of every new academic year for BE, TE and SE students from INFT. Keep an eye out for an email notifying the same. 
- Secretaries and Deputy Secretaries coordinate with the functioning Teams:
  - Tech
  - Content
  - Graphics
  - PR
  - Social Media
  
# How to approach us?

- Just look around, there's probably a QuestIT council member in your friends group üòâ
